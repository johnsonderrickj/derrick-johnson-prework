# Minnesota Twins Hangman Game

This project is a classic hangman game based on some players on the 2020 Minnesota Twins. To play, the user will simply type letters when the index page is pulled up, and their guesses will either fill in an underscore of the correct word or go to the already guessed section. If the user guesses right, an image of that player will pop up on the left side, and a cheering noise will play. If the user guesses the wrong letters 12 times, they will be notified to try again and the game will reset with the same word to give them another chance to guess that player.

Some minor issues involve the photos and the word generation. Once I had photos chosen of the players, I edited them and wanted to replace the originals I had first pushed to the images folder, but I was having a hard time deleting the older images. This is why there are copies of images in .jpg and .png format. Also, the list of words is limited, so sometimes when the function chooses one at random the same word can appear twice or more in a row, though this happens infrequently.

However, the game itself works, and I hope you enjoy guessing players from the Twins!
